## To run robosuite on the joystick
```cd robosuite```
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

```mjpython robosuite/demos/demo_device_control.py --device dualsense```

## To run Octo follow updated steps in the notebook

The complexity of steps there is due to impossibility to run Octo on MacOS or with any Python except 3.10. Collab would not allow to chnage the version of Python manually, so the only solution is to use conda in collab enforcing virtual environment in the notebook creating real headache.
